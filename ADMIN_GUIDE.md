## üèóÔ∏è **Arena Creation & Management**

### **Step-by-Step Arena Creation**

#### **Phase 1: Planning Your Arena**
1. **Choose Location**: Select a suitable area (recommended: 100x100 blocks minimum)
2. **Design Layout**: Plan team bases, flag locations, and capture points
3. **WorldGuard Region**: Create a protective region around your arena

#### **Phase 2: WorldGuard Setup**
```bash
# Select your arena area with WorldEdit
//pos1  # Click first corner
//pos2  # Click opposite corner

# Create the region
/rg define ctf_arena_1

# Set basic flags (optional)
/rg flag ctf_arena_1 pvp allow
/rg flag ctf_arena_1 build deny
/rg flag ctf_arena_1 chest-access deny
```

#### **Phase 3: CTF Arena Creation**
```bash
# Create the arena
/ctfadmin create arena1 ctf_arena_1

# You'll receive an admin toolkit automatically
# If you need it again later:
/ctfadmin setup arena1
```

#### **Phase 4: Configure Arena Components**

**4.1 Set Lobby Spawn**
```bash
# Stand where players should spawn when joining
/ctfadmin setlobby arena1
```

**4.2 Set Team Spawn Points (4 per team required)**
```bash
# Red team spawns
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 red 1
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 red 2
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 red 3
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 red 4

# Blue team spawns
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 blue 1
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 blue 2
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 blue 3
/ctfadmin setspawn arena1 blue 4
```

**4.3 Set Flag Locations**
```bash
# Stand at red team's flag location
/ctfadmin setflag arena1 red
# Click the block where the flag should be placed

# Stand at blue team's flag location
/ctfadmin setflag arena1 blue
# Click the block where the flag should be placed
```

**4.4 Set Capture Points**
```bash
# Stand at red team's capture zone
/ctfadmin setcapture arena1 red
# Click the block for capture zone center

# Stand at blue team's capture zone
/ctfadmin setcapture arena1 blue
# Click the block for capture zone center
```

#### **Phase 5: Validation & Activation**
```bash
# Check arena status
/ctfadmin status arena1

# Save and enable arena (only works if fully configured)
/ctfadmin save arena1
```

### **Arena Management Commands**

#### **Viewing Arena Information**
```bash
# List all arenas
/ctfadmin list

# Detailed arena status
/ctfadmin status <arena_name>

# View setup progress with boss bar
/ctfadmin setup <arena_name>
```

#### **Modifying Existing Arenas**

## üèÜ **Hologram Leaderboard Management**

### **Prerequisites for Holograms**
- DecentHolograms plugin must be installed and enabled
- Server restart required after installing DecentHolograms

### **Creating Leaderboards**

#### **Basic Leaderboard Creation**
```bash
# Create a kills leaderboard (default size: 5)
/ctfadmin leaderboard create kills

# Create leaderboard with custom size (1-15)
/ctfadmin leaderboard create captures 10
/ctfadmin leaderboard create level 8
/ctfadmin leaderboard create games_won 5
```

#### **Available Leaderboard Types**
| Type | Description | Data Source |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `kills` | Total player kills | `total_kills` |
| `captures` | Total flag captures | `total_captures` |
| `level` | Player levels | `level` |
| `games_won` | Games won | `games_won` |

### **Managing Leaderboards**

#### **Viewing Leaderboards**
```bash
# List all leaderboards with status
/ctfadmin leaderboard list

# Example output:
# kills_1647891234567 (Top Kills, Size: 10) - Enabled ‚úî
# level_1647891234568 (Top Levels, Size: 5) - Enabled ‚úî
```

#### **Moving Leaderboards**
```bash
# Move leaderboard to your current location
/ctfadmin leaderboard move <leaderboard_id>

# Example:
/ctfadmin leaderboard move kills_1647891234567
```

#### **Deleting Leaderboards**
```bash
# Delete a leaderboard (cannot be undone!)
/ctfadmin leaderboard delete <leaderboard_id>
```

#### **Updating Leaderboards**
```bash
# Force immediate update of all leaderboards
/ctfadmin leaderboard reload
```

### **Leaderboard Placement Strategy**

#### **Recommended Locations**
- **Spawn/Lobby Areas**: High visibility for all players
- **Arena Entrances**: Build excitement before games
- **Hall of Fame Areas**: Dedicated statistics viewing areas
- **Tournament Areas**: Special event spaces

#### **Placement Tips**
- Place at eye level (Y-coordinate around 65-70)
- Ensure clear line of sight
- Avoid placing too close to walls or obstructions
- Leave 3-4 block spacing between multiple leaderboards
- Consider lighting for better visibility

### **Leaderboard Design Customization**

#### **Size Recommendations**
- **Lobby Areas**: 5-10 entries (balanced visibility)
- **Hall of Fame**: 10-15 entries (comprehensive view)
- **Tournament Areas**: 3-5 entries (focused competition)
- **Arena Entrances**: 5 entries (quick motivation)

#### **Type Selection Strategy**
- **PvP Servers**: Kills, K/D ratio leaderboards
- **Community Servers**: Level, games won leaderboards
- **Competitive Servers**: All types for comprehensive tracking
- **Casual Servers**: Captures, level leaderboards

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue: Leaderboards Not Displaying**
**Symptoms**: Created leaderboards don't appear in-game

**Solutions**:
1. **Check DecentHolograms**:
   ```bash
   /plugins
   # Ensure DecentHolograms is green (enabled)
   ```

2. **Verify Creation**:
   ```bash
   /ctfadmin leaderboard list
   # Check if leaderboard exists and is enabled
   ```

3. **Check Console**:
   ```
   Look for errors mentioning:
   - "DecentHolograms not found"
   - "Failed to create hologram"
   ```

4. **Manual Reload**:
   ```bash
   /ctfadmin leaderboard reload
   ```

#### **Issue: Arena Won't Save/Enable**
**Symptoms**: "/ctfadmin save" fails with validation errors

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Status**:
   ```bash
   /ctfadmin status <arena_name>
   # Review what's missing (lobby, spawns, flags, captures)
   ```

2. **Common Missing Components**:
   - **Lobby**: Set with `/ctfadmin setlobby <arena>`
   - **Spawns**: Need 4 per team (8 total)
   - **Flags**: Need both red and blue flag locations
   - **Captures**: Need both red and blue capture points

3. **WorldGuard Region**:
   ```bash
   /rg info <region_name>
   # Ensure region exists and is properly defined
   ```

#### **Issue: Players Can't Join Games**
**Symptoms**: Players get error messages when trying to join

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Permissions**:
   ```bash
   /lp user <player> permission check ctf.play
   ```

2. **Arena Status**:
   ```bash
   /ctfadmin list
   # Ensure arena shows as "Enabled"
   ```

3. **Game Requirements**:
   - Check if minimum players requirement is met
   - Verify arena isn't already full
   - Ensure game isn't already in progress

#### **Issue: Statistics Not Updating**
**Symptoms**: Player stats or leaderboards show old data

**Solutions**:
1. **Force Leaderboard Update**:
   ```bash
   /ctfadmin leaderboard reload
   ```

2. **Check Player Data File**:
   ```bash
   # Verify /plugins/CTF-Core/playerdata.yml exists and has data
   ```

3. **Game Completion**:
   - Stats only update after games complete
   - Ensure games are ending properly

### **Debug Mode**

#### **Enable Debug Logging**
Add to `config.yml`:
```yaml
debug:
  enabled: true
  verbose: true
```

This will provide detailed console output for troubleshooting.

#### **Analyzing Log Files**
```bash
# Check recent logs for CTF-Core messages
tail -n 100 logs/latest.log | grep CTF

# Look for specific error patterns:
# - "Failed to create"
# - "Could not load"
# - "Permission denied"
# - "Invalid configuration"
```

## üèÖ **Best Practices**

### **Arena Design Guidelines**

#### **Layout Principles**
1. **Symmetrical Design**: Ensure fair gameplay for both teams
2. **Multiple Routes**: Provide various paths between bases
3. **Strategic Elements**: Include cover, high ground, chokepoints
4. **Clear Sight Lines**: Avoid overly complex maze designs
5. **Appropriate Scale**: 80-120 block distance between flags optimal

#### **Spawn Point Placement**
- **Safe Zones**: Spawns should be protected from enemy camping
- **Multiple Options**: 4 spawns per team prevent spawn killing
- **Strategic Positions**: Near but not on the flag location
- **Quick Access**: Clear path to flag and capture points

#### **Flag and Capture Positioning**
- **Defendable Locations**: Flags should be protectable but not impossible to reach
- **Clear Markers**: Use distinctive blocks/structures for flag locations
- **Capture Point Distance**: 20-40 blocks from enemy flag optimal
- **Visual Clarity**: Make capture zones obvious with colored blocks

### **Server Performance Optimization**

#### **Recommended Settings for Large Servers**
```yaml
# For 100+ concurrent players
leaderboards:
  settings:
    update-interval: 60    # Reduce frequency
    max-size: 10          # Limit size

game:
  max-players: 16        # Per arena limit
  
performance:
  async-saves: true      # If available in future updates
```

#### **Resource Management**
- **Limit Concurrent Games**: 3-5 active arenas maximum
- **Monitor Entity Count**: Power-ups and effects add entities
- **Regular Cleanup**: Use `/ctfadmin reload` during low-traffic times

### **Community Management**

#### **Rank System Integration**
```yaml
# Example progression rewards
# Level 10: VIP rank
# Level 25: Elite rank
# Level 50: Legend rank

# Implement with permission plugin hooks
```

#### **Tournament Organization**
```bash
# Weekly tournament setup:
# 1. Create dedicated tournament arena
# 2. Set up comprehensive leaderboards
# 3. Use /ctfadmin forcestart for organized matches
# 4. Track statistics for prizes/rewards
```

#### **Player Engagement Strategies**
- **Daily/Weekly Leaderboard Resets**: Keep competition fresh
- **Seasonal Events**: Special arena themes and rewards
- **Achievement Systems**: Use statistics for milestone rewards
- **Community Challenges**: Server-wide capture goals

### **Maintenance Schedule**

#### **Daily Tasks**
- Check console for errors
- Monitor active games
- Review player feedback

#### **Weekly Tasks**
- Backup configuration files
- Review and clean up playerdata.yml
- Update leaderboard positions if desired
- Check for plugin updates

#### **Monthly Tasks**
- Analyze player statistics trends
- Consider new arena additions
- Review and optimize configuration
- Plan community events
