# CTF-Core Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NullPointerException in PlayerJoinListener
**Problem**: 
```java
java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "org.cwresports.ctfcore.models.Arena$TeamColor.getName()" because the return value of "org.cwresports.ctfcore.managers.GameManager$PlayerReconnectionData.getTeam()" is null
```

**Root Cause**: Players disconnecting during respawn/cooldown phase had null team data stored in reconnection data.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added null safety checks in `restorePlayerToGame()` method
- Enhanced `handlePlayerDisconnect()` to validate team data before storing reconnection info
- Added error handling with try-catch in `PlayerJoinListener.onPlayerJoin()`
- Added fallback logic to send players to server lobby when reconnection fails

### 2. Cooldown Game Exit Handling
**Problem**: Players who exit during cooldown/respawn period were being restored to the same game upon reconnection.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added cooldown state tracking with `playerCooldownStatus` map
- Enhanced reconnection logic to detect cooldown disconnections
- Players who disconnect during cooldown are now sent to main server lobby on reconnection
- Added time-based cooldown detection (30-second threshold)

### 3. General Reconnection Improvements
**Enhancements**:
- Added comprehensive validation of reconnection data
- Improved error logging for debugging reconnection issues
- Added new message keys for different reconnection scenarios:
  - `reconnection-failed-to-lobby`
  - `cooldown-exit-to-lobby` 
  - `game-ended-to-lobby`
- Enhanced cleanup of player states (spawn protection, kill streaks, cooldown status)

## Code Changes

### GameManager.java
1. **Enhanced `handlePlayerReconnection()`**:
   - Added null safety validation for team data
   - Added cooldown detection logic
   - Added fallback to server lobby for failed reconnections
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **Enhanced `restorePlayerToGame()`**:
   - Added null safety checks for team data
   - Added graceful error handling with lobby fallback
   - Improved validation before restoration

3. **Enhanced `handlePlayerDisconnect()`**:
   - Added validation before storing reconnection data
   - Added better logging for debugging
   - Only stores reconnection data when team and arena are valid

4. **Enhanced `startRespawnCountdown()`**:
   - Added cooldown state tracking
   - Enhanced player state management during respawn

5. **Added cooldown state management**:
   - New `playerCooldownStatus` map to track cooldown states
   - Added cleanup of cooldown status in relevant methods
   - Added `isPlayerInCooldown()` utility method

### PlayerJoinListener.java
- Added try-catch error handling around reconnection logic
- Added fallback to server lobby on reconnection errors
- Improved error logging

### messages.yml
- Added new message keys for enhanced reconnection feedback:
  - `reconnection-failed-to-lobby`
  - `cooldown-exit-to-lobby`
  - `game-ended-to-lobby`

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Normal Reconnection
1. Player joins game and plays normally
2. Player disconnects (network issue)
3. Player reconnects within reasonable time
4. **Expected**: Player is restored to their game with same team

### Test Case 2: Cooldown Exit
1. Player dies in game and enters respawn cooldown
2. Player disconnects during cooldown period
3. Player reconnects
4. **Expected**: Player is sent to main server lobby, not back to game

### Test Case 3: Corrupted Data Handling  
1. Player has corrupted reconnection data (null team)
2. Player tries to reconnect
3. **Expected**: No NullPointerException, player sent to lobby with error message

### Test Case 4: Game Ended During Disconnect
1. Player disconnects from active game
2. Game ends while player is offline
3. Player reconnects
4. **Expected**: Player sent to server lobby with appropriate message

## Configuration
No configuration changes required. The fixes use existing configuration values and add backward-compatible message keys.

## Deployment Notes
- Plugin requires restart to load the new code
- No database changes required
- Backwards compatible with existing player data
- New message keys will use fallback if not added to messages.yml
